# Overview

This is a Flask-based AI-powered disease prediction system that uses machine learning to analyze user-selected symptoms and predict possible medical conditions. The application provides an educational tool that helps users understand potential health conditions based on symptoms, complete with disease information, prevention tips, and treatment recommendations. It emphasizes that the tool is for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The system uses a traditional server-side rendered approach with Flask templates and Bootstrap for styling. The frontend consists of:

- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templates with a base layout and specialized pages for symptom selection and results display
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 with dark theme for responsive design and consistent styling
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript for form validation, symptom counting, and user experience enhancements
- **Icons**: Font Awesome for visual elements and improved user interface

## Backend Architecture
The application follows a modular Flask architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Main Application**: Flask app with session management and debug logging
- **Route Handling**: Dedicated routes module handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Business Logic**: DiseasePredictor class encapsulating all machine learning and prediction logic
- **Data Generation**: Separate module for creating training data and building ML models

## Machine Learning Pipeline
The system implements a comprehensive ML approach:

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Uses RandomForest, MultinomialNB, and LogisticRegression for ensemble predictions
- **Model Persistence**: Saves trained models using joblib for efficient loading and prediction
- **Synthetic Data**: Generates realistic medical training data based on disease-symptom probability patterns
- **Prediction Confidence**: Provides confidence scores alongside predictions

## Data Management
The application manages medical data through:

- **Symptom Database**: Predefined list of common medical symptoms with standardized naming
- **Disease Catalog**: Comprehensive disease information including descriptions, prevention tips, and treatments
- **Pattern Matching**: Disease-symptom probability matrices for realistic data generation
- **Model Storage**: Persistent storage of trained ML models for quick loading

# External Dependencies

## Python Libraries
- **Flask**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and rendering templates
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library providing RandomForest, MultinomialNB, and LogisticRegression algorithms
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis for handling training datasets
- **numpy**: Numerical computing for array operations and mathematical functions
- **joblib**: Model serialization and deserialization for persistent storage

## Frontend Dependencies
- **Bootstrap 5**: CSS framework from CDN for responsive UI components and dark theme styling
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library from CDN for visual enhancements and user interface elements

## Development Tools
- **Logging**: Python's built-in logging module for debugging and application monitoring
- **Environment Variables**: OS environment variable support for configuration management

The system is designed to be self-contained with no external databases or third-party APIs, making it easy to deploy and run in various environments.
